# GDScript Formatter Action

An extraordinarily simple Github action, it just serves to format GDScript code for people working with the Godot game engine. This is just a matter of connecting existing open source work out there and packaging it for Github Actions.

## Dependencies

- [GDFormat from GDScript Toolkit](github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit) to format the code.
- [Create Pull Request by Peter Evans](github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) to create the actual PR after modifying the code.
